## Introduction

Welcome to BASED (Bias Assessment of SpEech Datasets)! 🎉 This is my final year honours project developed during AY24-25 Semester 1.

The aim of this project is to develop a web-based application that can detect and assess bias in speech data. As speech data is increasingly used in various fields, including Speech To Text (STT) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. Since models tend to favor the most common answers in their training data, analyzing data bias will provide valuable insights for developers.

Apart from the bias assessment and visualizations, there's also an experiment feature to predict the english accents (native or foreign) of the user-uploaded audio files. Feel free to explore! 🔍
